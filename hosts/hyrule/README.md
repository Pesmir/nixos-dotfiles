My portable notebook. This Lenovo T470 lineally descends from my previous Lenovo Thinkpads, the chunky Lenovo T400 and the lightweight Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 3. It is my first laptop running NixOS as a daily driver.


## Hardware Details

For hardware details of the Lenovo T470, see [this page](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470-Core-i5-Full-HD-Notebook-Review.198130.0.html).

The model I have has the following specifications:

  - **CPU**: [Intel Core i5-7300U](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/97472/intel-core-i57300u-processor-3m-cache-up-to-3-50-ghz.html)
  - **RAM**: 2 x 8GB SK Hynix DDR4 Synchronous Unbuffered (2133MT/s)
  - **Disk**: Samsung PM961 NVMe PCIe M.2 256GB


## Configuration
On the go I still enjoy KDE Plasma over window managers like Hyprland and bspwm. The configuration for **grape** is still very much a work in progress, so expect things to change.
